        <p>Hi, my name is <em>Saad</em> I was born on 29<sup>th</sup> April 2005, I am from <Strong>Morocco</Strong> and I grew up in a small city called <B>Taounate</B>. I graduated from high school in 2022 at <Strong>Lycce Al Wahda</Strong>. and after that, I went to Marrakesh to study at ALC while I was waiting for my Canadian visa.</p>
    <p> After I got my visa, I went back to my city to say goodbye to my family, so I spent some time with them. And the hard part was saying goodbye at the airport. it was so <em>emotional</em>. After I got there, I was confused about what should I do, I was lucky that I met a guy from my country so he helped me with everything that I needed to do</p>
