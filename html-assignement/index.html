            <img src="images/fares.jpg" alt="fares" id="my-image">
        <p>Hi, my name is <em>Saad</em>. I was born on 29<sup>th</sup> April 2005, I am from <strong>Morocco</strong> and I grew up in a small city called <strong>Taounate</strong>. I graduated from high school in 2022 at <strong>Lyc√©e Al Wahda</strong>, and after that, I went to Marrakesh to study at ALC while I was waiting for my Canadian visa.</p>
        <p>After I got my visa, I went back to my city to say goodbye to my family, so I spent some time with them. The hard part was saying goodbye at the airport; it was so <em>emotional</em>. After I got to Canada, I was confused about what to do, but I was lucky to meet a guy from my country who helped me with everything I needed to do.</p>
